      <h2>Welcome to the best page about Bass Guitars!</h2>
      <p>The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.</p>

      <p>The four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the double bass, which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). However, it is also possible to tune the strings differently for playing specific genres of songs.</p>
      <p>Bass is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or with a pick. In order to be heard at normal performance volumes, electric basses require external amplification.</p><br>
